# Reservoirpy - Python

## Introduction.
This package is being designed to provide Petroleum Engineering tools in a modern programming language. This package is part of a project which proposes to make basic but powerful engineering software packages that cover the main topics of the Oil and Gas development phases which could be applied to any case study by suitable engineers.

There are five topics in which the project is going to be focused on:

<br>-Geoscience
<br>-Reservoir
<br>-Production
<br>-Economics
<br>-Integration

<br> The package will always be in permanent development and open to suggestions to enhance the program. As the code has been written so far by a code enthusiastic Petroleum Engineer I hope to learn as much as possible to get better and usefull programs.
